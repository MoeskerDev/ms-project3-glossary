# UX
## Project Goals
Creating a jargon glossary for three growing fields in IT: Cyber Security, Data Analytics and Web Development. The idea is that visitors can find and share definitions by reading, creating, editing and deleting terms and definitions.

The final goal is to publish a book including the collection of good definitions for all three fields and in addition, a word cloud.

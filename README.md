# UX
## Project Goals
Creating a jargon glossary for three growing fields in IT: Cyber Security, Data Analytics and Web Development. The idea is that visitors can find and share definitions by reading, creating, editing and deleting terms and definitions.

The final goal is to publish a book including the collection of good definitions for all three fields and in addition, a word cloud.

## User Stories
1. First Time Visitor Goals
    - As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and scroll through all terms.
    - As a user, I want to easily navigate through the application to find and read terms relating to a specific field.
    - As a user, I want to be able to add new terms with their respective definition to add to the collection of important terms in the field.
    - As a user, I want to be able to edit the definition of terms to improve the quality of the site.
    - As a user, I want to be able to delete certain terms to ensure updated relevancy of the collection of terms.
    - As a user, I want to be able to see which terms are most frequently searched for.

2. Returning Visitor Goals
    - As a returning user, I want to see which terms are new on the site.

## Design choices
### Fonts
- Materialize uses Roboto font 
### Icons
- All icons have the purpose to add or explicitly visually show the purpose of the related elements.
### Colours
In essence, the idea was to keep it clean, but still play with a few colours that are not a total mismatch.
- The colour scheme is based on the following colours from Materialize:
    - #009688 teal for the headers, collapsible headers, card-titles, forms, flash messages and text.
    - #00897b teal darken-1 for the 'submit' buttons
    - #fbe9e7 deep-orange lighten-5 for the overall background colour
    - #bf360c deep-orange darken-4 to make the navbar stand out and for the delete buttons
    - #ff9e80 deep-orange accent-1 for the edit buttons
    - #ff5722 deep-orange for the reset and return back to homepage buttons
    - #9e9e9e grey and #546e7a blue-grey darken-1 for the card panels
    - #ffffff white text in the sidenavbar, grey and blue-grey darken-1 card panels to make links and text stand out.
